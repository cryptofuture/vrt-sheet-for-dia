# Donation

Consider making a donation, if you like what I doing.
I working remotely and income is unstable, so every little bit helps.

Also it would be nice if you provide, a note on `admin@hda.me` after making a donation with information what you like and what you want to improve. So, I would consider giving more time and support to particular project.

I also open to reasonable work offers, especially if offer would be close to a field or project I work with.
